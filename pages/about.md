<br>Hi I am **Thang Luu**
<br>Hey, thank you for your visiting.

<br>This is my little space, so I have to say something about myself. 
<br>Sometimes it is hard to introduce yourself because you know yourself so well that you do not know where to start with. 
<br>Let me give a try to see what kind of image you have about me through my self-description. 
<br>I hope that my impression about myself and your impression about me are not so different.

<br>I am a person who is positive about every aspect of life. 
<br>There are many things I like to do, to see, and to experience. 
<br>I like to read. I like to write. I like to think. I like to dream. I like to listen.
<br>I like to see the sunrise in the morning. I like to see the moonlight at night. 
<br>I like to feel the music flowing on my face. I like to smell the wind coming from the ocean. 
<br>I like to look at the clouds in the sky with a blank mind. 
<br>I like to do thought experiment when I cannot sleep in the middle of the night.
<br>I like to be surrounded by people.
<br>I like countryâ€™s peace.
<br>I like the land and the nature.

<br>Now, I am working as a data engineer at a retail company in Japan.
<br>Heretofore, I was born and raised in a small countryside, beside a beautiful beach in Vietnam.

<br>a little Vietnamese expat in Japan ;)
